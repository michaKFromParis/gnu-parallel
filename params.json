{"name":"Gnu-parallel-sticky","tagline":"fork of GNU parallel to add support for job tagging / hosts tagging to allow jobs to stick to hosts if required","body":"## Gnu parallel sticky\r\nThis project is a fork of GNU parallel version 20141022 by O. Tange and fetched from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/parallel.git.\r\nGNU parallel is a great tool to distribute tasks on multicore machines / grids of hosts over the network. See the original website here: http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/ and its tutorial here: http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/parallel_tutorial.html\r\n\r\nWhen using the network distribution scheme, the tasks are distributed in a random way with no control over the destination host of a specific task as explained by the original author here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26645042/gnu-parallel-host-sticky-jobs/26647768#26647768\r\n\r\nThis version of parallel should work transparently with your previous parallel usages but adds a simple grammar to tag jobs and hosts. Here is a little example that shows you the difference in the grammar by distributing 3 sleep commands to 3 different hosts to sleep for 5, 15 and 10 seconds remotely to simulate a time consuming task.\r\n\r\n## Tutorial\r\n\r\n#### Regular parallel grammar:\r\n\r\n```\r\nparallel -j1 --tag \\\r\n--sshlogin 16/hostname1 \\\r\n--sshlogin 8/user@hostname2 \\\r\n--sshlogin 8/hostname3 \\\r\n\"sleep\" ::: 5 15 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the jobs will be distributed completely randomly to the various hosts\r\n\r\n#### Sticky parallel grammar:\r\n\r\n```\r\nparallel -j1 --tag \\\r\n--sshlogin 16/iOS+Android/hostname1 \\\r\n--sshlogin 4/iOS/user@hostname2 \\\r\n--sshlogin 8/OSX/hostname3 \\\r\n\"sleep\" :::5@iOS 15@Android 10@OSX\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nYou can tag any host with any number of arbitrary tags separated by the **+** sign\r\nYou can then tag any job with a tag by adding the tag name to it using the **@** sign\r\n\r\nFirst, host tagging:\r\n\r\n+ hostname1 is tagged with the tags \"iOS\" and \"Android\"\r\n+ hostname2 is tagged with the tag \"iOS\"\r\n+ hostname3 is tagged with the tag \"OSX\"\r\n\r\nthen job tagging:\r\n\r\n+ job \"5\" is tagged with the tag \"iOS\"\r\n+ job \"15\" is tagged with the tag \"Android\"\r\n+ job \"10\" is tagged with the tag \"OSX\"\r\n\r\n### Outcome\r\n\r\njob 5 will be sent to hostname1 or hostname2 as they both support jobs of type \"iOS\"\r\njob 15 will be sent to hostname1 as it is the only one supporting jobs of type \"Android\" or wait for job 5 to complete\r\njob 10 will be sent to hostname3\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nThis code is a a fork by @michaKFromParis of GNU parallel version 20141022 by O.
